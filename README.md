# Javascript Counter

This project is part of my educational journey and was developed as an assigned task for the completion of a course module.
The counter was built entirely with JavaScript, as required by the course.
I chose to implement the counter with a modern digital style, inspired by digital clocks, including clean visual design and effects like blurred backgrounds.
